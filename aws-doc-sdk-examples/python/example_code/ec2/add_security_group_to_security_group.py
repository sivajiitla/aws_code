    """Add a security group to another security group

    Adding a security group to another security group allows traffic
    from EC2 instances associated with the added group.

    For example, assume the following scenario:
      * EC2 instance #1 uses security group #1
      * EC2 instance #2 uses security group #2
    If security group #2 is added to security group #1 then EC2 instance #1
    will accept traffic from EC2 instance #2.

    Traffic is allowed from the private IP addresses of the EC2 instances, not
    the public IP or Elastic IP addresses. All types of traffic are allowed
    (UDP, TCP, and ICMP).

    Note: Adding a security group does not add the group's rules to the
    modified group.

    If a different AWS account owns the added security group then the account
    ID must be specified in the source_security_group_owner_id argument.

    :param security_group_id: ID of the security group to be modified
    :param source_security_group_name: Name of the security group to add
    :param source_security_group_owner_id: AWS account ID that owns the added
    security group. This argument is required only if the modified and added
    security groups are in different AWS accounts.
    :return True if group was added. Otherwise, False.
