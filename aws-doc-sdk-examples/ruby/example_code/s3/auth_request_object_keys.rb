# This snippet example does the following:
# Creates an instance of the Aws::S3::Resource class. 
# Makes a request to Amazon S3 by enumerating objects in a bucket using the bucket method of Aws::S3::Resource. 
# The client generates the necessary signature value from the credentials in the AWS credentials file on your computer, 
# and includes it in the request it sends to Amazon S3.
# Prints the array of object key names to the terminal.
# The credentials that are used for this example come from a local AWS credentials file on the computer that is running this application. 
# The credentials are for an IAM user who can list objects in the bucket that the user specifies when they run the application.

# Use the Amazon S3 modularized gem for version 3 of the AWS Ruby SDK.
require 'aws-sdk-s3'

# Get an Amazon S3 resource.
s3 = Aws::S3::Resource.new(region: 'us-west-2')

# Create an array of up to the first 100 object keynames in the bucket.
bucket = s3.bucket('example_bucket').objects.collect(&:key)

# Print the array to the terminal.
puts bucket
